# Py for Nurses

2022.06.25


* [There's no getting away from it, coding is becoming a basic skill everyone could make good use of. We even teach it to five-year-olds in school these days! The dramatic progress in communication technologies means that almost every aspect of our lives touches on some tech you could customise and improve on, if only you spoke the language of machines. That goes for our nursing life too.
Service users don't hang about waiting for us to acquire skills, they will race ahead without us if we sleep on this. Patients were using social media before many of us, sharing knowledge and supporting each other, but only recently has that made some impact on the student nurse curriculum. Mobile tech is developing an internet-of-things where sensors and basic processing is embedded everywhere, with extensive wireless communication networks, bringing with it fantastic opportunities and yes, dangers, for healthcare. Vitalpac and Safe Hands are just two examples where this is already happening, with nurses intimately involved. Now, I'm not arguing that nurses should take another three years out to do a computer science degree as well, but being able to speak some of the language, know the terrain, would better allow us to advocate for service users in emerging technology areas. And use some of it directly ourselves.
It's not nearly as hard to learn as you might expect.](https://www.nurseadvance.com/articles/python-makes-coding-useful-and-fun-nurses-making-nurseadvance-part-2/)
