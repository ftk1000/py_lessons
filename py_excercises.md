1) Write a function computing distance between two points A=[1,4] and B=[-3,7]

          def distance_between_two_points(A, B):
            ''' function computing distance between two points A=[1,4] and B=[-3,7]
                returns a number '''
                
                # write your code here
                
                
 
2) Write a function computing perimeter of a triangle ABC with  A=[1,4], B=[-3,7], C=[-5,-2]

          def perimeter(A, B, C):
            ''' function computing perimeter of a triangle ABC
                returns a number '''
                
                # write your code here
                
                
 
3) Write a function which finds all words with the same ROOT='shoe' in TEXT="here is some test about shoe, shoeman, shoewoman and shoes".

          def find_words_with_root(TEXT, ROOT):
            ''' function finds all words with the same ROOT in TEXT
                returns a list of words '''
                
                # write your code here
